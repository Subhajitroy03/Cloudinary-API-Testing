# Cloudinary API Sample Project

This is a **sample project structure** demonstrating how to use the **Cloudinary API** to upload photos or files using `multer`, store them in **Cloudinary**, and view the uploaded media.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Upload photos/files via form input
- Use `multer` middleware to handle file uploads
- Store uploaded media directly in **Cloudinary**
- View uploaded media in the frontend
- Modular structure (MVC-based) for easy reuse in other projects

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Multer
- Cloudinary SDK
- EJS (for basic frontend rendering)

This project can serve as a base or utility in other projects where file/image uploading and Cloudinary integration are required.

Feel free to optimize the structure
